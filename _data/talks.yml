      title: Realized Candlestick Wicks
      abstract: We develop a novel nonparametric estimator of integrated variance that utilizes intraday candlestick information, comprised of the high, low, open, and close prices within short time intervals. The proposed estimator is robust to short-lived extreme return persistence hardly attributable to the diffusion component, such as gradual jumps and flash crashes. By modelling such sharp but continuous price movements following some recent theoretical advances, we demonstrate that our new estimator can provide consistent estimates with variances about four times smaller than those obtained with the differenced-return volatility (DV) estimator. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications further validate the practical reliability of our proposed estimator with some finite-sample refinements.

      title: BUMVU Estimators
      abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an (Unbiased) Block estimator to have Uniformly Minimum Variance. Our theory parallels the theory of UMVU estimation, the main novel insight being the focus on the covariance among blocks. We use this theory to derive lower variance bounds for block estimators of functionals of high-frequency volatility when the block size is fixed. We further show the relevance of the new theory for the classical problem of estimation of homoskedastic nonparametric regressions with varying mean. Finally, we introduce a new test for the presence of drift in financial data which exploits the precision of BUMVU estimators. The test shows abundant presence of drift in financial data.

      title: Deep Parametric Portfolio Policies 
      abstract: We generalize the parametric portfolio policy framework to portfolio weight functions of any complexity by using deep neural networks. More complex network-based portfolio policies increase investor utility and achieve between 75 and 276 basis points higher monthly certainty equivalent returns than a comparable linear portfolio policy. Risk aversion serves an important function as an economically motivated model regularization parameter, with higher risk aversion leaning against model complexity. Overall, our findings demonstrate that, looking beyond expected returns, network-based policies better capture the non-linear relationship between investor utility and firm characteristics but the benefits of using complex models vary with investor preferences. Results hold after considering realistic portfolio settings with short sale or weight restrictions and returns after transaction costs.

      title: Fill Probabilities in a Limit Order Book with State-Dependent Stochastic Order Flows
      abstract: We delve into the computation of fill probabilities for limit orders positioned at various price levels within the limit order book, a critical aspect in execution optimization. We adopt a generic stochastic model to capture the dynamics of the order book as a series of queueing systems. This generic model is state-dependent and encompasses stylized factors. We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the fill probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper in the book, before the opposite best quote moves. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical experiments using real order book data from the foreign exchange spot market.

      title: Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process
      abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.

      title: Empirical Crypto Asset Pricing using Factor Models with High-Dimensional Asset Characteristics
      abstract: We study the dynamics of crypto asset returns through the lens of factor models. Given the limited number of tradable assets and years of data and the rich set of available asset characteristics, we develop novel estimation procedures with supporting econometric theory for a dynamic latent-factor model with high-dimensional asset characteristics, that is, the number of characteristics is on the order of the sample size. Utilizing the Double Selection Lasso estimator, our procedure employs regularization to eliminate characteristics with low signal-to-noise ratios yet maintains asymptotically valid inference for our asset pricing tests. In our empirical panel, we find the new estimator obtains comparable out-of-sample pricing ability and risk-adjusted returns to benchmark methods. We provide an inference procedure for measuring the risk premium of an observable nontradable factor, and employ this to find crypto's inflation-mimicking portfolio has positive risk compensation. Finally, specifying a factor model with nonparametric loadings and factors, we utilize recent methods in deep learning to maximize out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns in an hourly panel, which yields economically significant alphas even after a detailed accounting of transaction costs.

      title: Economic Forecast Using Many Noise 
      abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental question in economic forecasting&#58; is variable selection beneficial to predictions?  Economists typically conduct variable selection to eliminate noise from predictors. However,  we provide a theoretical justification that economic forecast models are not sparse. In addition,  we prove a compelling result&#58; in most economic forecasts, including noise in predictions yields greater benefits than its exclusion.  Furthermore, if the total number of predictors is not sufficiently large,  intentionally adding more noise yields superior forecast performance, outperforming benchmark predictors relying on dimension reduction. The intuition lies in economic predictive signals being densely distributed among regression coefficients, maintaining modest forecast bias while diversifying away overall variance. Therefore, economic forecasts can significantly benefit from the 'benign overfitting' even if a significant proportion of predictors constitute pure noise.    One of our empirical demonstrations shows that intentionally adding 300-6000 pure noise to the Welch and Goyal ( 2008 ) dataset  archives  a noteworthy 10% out-of-sample R squre accuracy in forecasting the annual U.S. equity premium.   The performance surpasses the majority of sophisticated machine learning models.

      title: Generative Machine Learning for Multivariate Equity Returns
      abstract: The use of machine learning to generate synthetic data has grown significantly in popularity over the past few years. The core methodology these models use is to learn the distribution of the underlying data, similar to the classical methods of fitting statistical models to data that are common in finance. In this presentation, we discuss the efficacy of using modern machine learning methods, specifically conditional importance weighted autoencoders (a variant of variational autoencoders) and conditional normalizing flows, to model the returns of equities. We apply our method to learn a 500-dimension joint distribution for SP 500 members. We show that this generative model has a broad range of applications in finance, including generating realistic synthetic data, volatility and correlation estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization.

      title: Deep Limit Order Book Forecasting
      abstract: We exploit cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to explore the predictability of high-frequency Limit Order Book mid-price changes for a heterogeneous set of stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange. In so doing, we release `LOBFrame', an open-source code base to efficiently process large-scale Limit Order Book data and quantitatively assess state-of-the-art deep learning models' forecasting capabilities. Our results are twofold. We demonstrate that the stocks' microstructural characteristics influence the efficacy of deep learning methods and that their high forecasting power does not necessarily correspond to actionable trading signals. We argue that traditional machine learning metrics fail to adequately assess the quality of forecasts in the Limit Order Book context. As an alternative, we propose an innovative operational framework that evaluates predictions' practicality by focusing on the probability of accurately forecasting complete transactions. This work offers academics and practitioners an avenue to make informed and robust decisions on the application of deep learning techniques, their scope and limitations, effectively exploiting emergent statistical properties of the Limit Order Book.

      title: Influential assets in Large-Scale Vector AutoRegressive Models
      abstract: When a company releases earnings results or makes announcements, a sectoral wide lead-lag effect from the stock on the entire system may occur. To improve the estimation of a system experiencing system-wide lead-lag effects from a single asset in the presence of short time series, we introduce a model for Large-scale Influencer Structures in Vector AutoRegressions (LISAR). We study the asymptotic properties of the estimator and validate its performance in extensive synthetic data experiments. We study the performance of the LISAR model on high-frequency data for the constituents of the SP100, separated by sectors. We find the LISAR model to significantly outperform on up to 14.7% of the days in terms of forecasting accuracy. Trading strategies with signals derived from the LISAR model achieved up to 60% excess return compared to other strategies. We show in this study, that in the presence of influencer structures within a sector, the LISAR model, compared to alternative models, provides higher accuracy, better forecasting results, and improves the understanding of market movements and sectoral structures.

      title: Real-time Machine Learning for the Cross-Section of Stock Returns
      abstract: Recent studies document strong performance for machine-learning-based investment strategies. These strategies use anomaly variables discovered ex-post as predictors of stock returns and may not be implementable in real time. We construct real-time machine learning strategies based on a universe of fundamental signals. While positive and significant, the out-of-sample performance of these strategies is significantly weaker than those documented by prior studies, especially in value-weighted portfolios. We find similar results when examining a universe of past return-based signals. Our results offer a more tempered view of the economic gains associated with machine learning strategies relative to prior literature.

      title: Blame it on the weather&#58; Market implied weather volatility and firm performance
      abstract: We introduce a novel measure of weather risk implied from weather options' contracts. WIVOL captures risks of future temperature oscillations, increasing with climate uncertainty about physical events and regulatory policies. We find that shocks to weather volatility increase the likelihood of unexpected costs&#58; a one-standard deviation change in WIVOL increases quarterly operating costs by 2%, suggesting that firms, on average, do not fully hedge exposures to weather risks. We estimate returns' exposure to WIVOL innovations and show that more negatively exposed firms are valued at a discount, with investors demanding higher compensations to hold these stocks. Firms' exposure to local but not foreign WIVOL predicts returns, which confirms the geographic nature of weather risks shocks.

      title: Deep Learning from Implied Volatility Surfaces
      abstract: We develop a novel methodology for extracting information from option implied volatility (IV) surfaces for the cross-section of stock returns, using image recognition techniques from machine learning (ML). The predictive information we identify is essentially uncorrelated with most of the existing option-implied characteristics, delivers a higher Sharpe ratio, and has a significant alpha relative to a battery of standard and option-implied factors. We show the virtue of ensemble complexity - Best results are achieved with a large ensemble of ML models, with the out-of-sample performance increasing in the ensemble size, saturating when the number of model parameters significantly exceeds the number of observations. We introduce principal linear features, an analog of principal components for ML, and use them to show IV feature complexity - A low-rank rotation of the IV surface cannot explain the model performance. Our results are robust to short-sale constraints and transaction costs.

      title: Bagged Forecast Combination for Tail Risk Measures
      abstract: Recent developments on joint scoring functions for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall allow for consistent implementation of statistical tests based on the Model Confidence Set (MCS). MCS-test is shown to be a powerful tool for model comparison, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Another branch of literature focused on the superior performance of convex forecast combinations, which often outperform stand-alone forecasting models. This paper combines both research directions and proposes a novel approach to a forecast combination of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall based on MCS-testing. By means of the bagged pretest forecasting combination (BPFC) algorithm we exploit the statistical properties of bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and combine competing models based on the bootstrapped probability of the model being in the MCS. The resulting forecast combination allows for a flexible and smooth switch between the underlying models and outperforms the corresponding stand-alone forecasts.

      title: On Consistency of Signatures Using Lasso
      abstract: Signature transforms are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time time series data, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection. This paper revisits some statistical properties of signature transform under stochastic integrals with a Lasso regression framework, both theoretically and numerically. Our study shows that, for processes and time series that are closer to Brownian motion or random walk with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, the Lasso regression is more consistent for their signatures defined by It\^o integrals; for mean reverting processes and time series, their signatures defined by Stratonovich integrals have more consistency in the Lasso regression. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing appropriate definitions of signatures and stochastic models in statistical inference and machine learning. This is joint work with Xin Guo and Chaoyi Zhao.

      title: Sorted-Penalty-Estimator with Highly Correlated Factors&#58; Inference and Applications in Finance
      abstract: The LASSO-type shrinkage method have become increasingly popular in the big data era. However, variable correlations can significantly compromise the stability and validity of such estimators. This paper advances the development of a correlation-robust LASSO-type estimator, the ordered-weighted-LASSO (OWL) estimator (Figueiredo and Nowak, 2016). We develop the (non)asymptotic properties of the OWL estimator, considering less restrictive conditions, including the alpha-mixing condition and accommodating heavier tails than the standard i.i.d. sub-Gaussian setting. Furthermore, we propose a de-biased version of this estimator and establish its asymptotic normality. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that the de-biased OWL estimator significantly reduces estimation errors. Empirically, we apply it to identify crucial factors from the factor zoo, revealing that, despite high correlation with numerous other factors, the market factor is the most influential in driving cross-sectional asset returns. Our findings also highlight the significant impact of liquidity, profitability and momentum-related factors on these returns.
